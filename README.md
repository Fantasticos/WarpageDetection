# WarpageDetection
CMU CERLAB Pointcloud Team, Warpage detection for windows

## Overview
This is a research project in CERLAB CMU, sponsored by YKK AP Inc. The goal for this project is to inspect the installation of windows in the construction site.This research proposes a high-precision and automated inspection workflow using the point cloud generated by 360-degree Laser Scanners. The scanned point cloud is compared with a sample cloud generated from the 3D CAD model. The sample model is registered to the window scan using Boolean Map descriptors and [Iterative Closest Point (ICP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_closest_point) algorithm to get its precise position and orientation. The point cloud is then segmented with a voxel grid, each voxel containing part of the windowâ€™s edge. By comparing the edge segments andthe ground truth in the CAD model, the warpage of the window frame is measured.
